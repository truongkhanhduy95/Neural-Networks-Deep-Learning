## Week 1: Introduction to deep learning

Learning Objectives

Understand the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
Be able to explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning.
Understand what are the major categories of models (such as CNNs and RNNs), and when they should be applied.
Be able to recognize the basics of when deep learning will (or will not) work well.

## Week 2: Neural Networks Basics

Learning Objectives
